# twitterCongress
A shinyapp created to explore sentiments detected in Congressional Twitter accounts.

So far, the most unique aspect of this app is the way it calls data: I employ data from GovTrack's Congress Member database, which includes each legislator's Twitter ID, to call the data from their respective Twitter accounts. 

THE PROBLEM: It's real slow. 

I will be making continual updates to this, but I have posted at this stage because I'm very proud of my double-API madness, even if it truly is too slow for realistic use.

Please get in touch if you have questions/comments/suggestions/wanna say hi. dkeetonolsen84@gmail.com or @DanielleRose84 on The Twitters.
